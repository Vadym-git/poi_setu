The app present a POI - points of interests.
Looks like main data unit will be the POI in a DB.
Base on this bellow the basic structure for a BOI unit, that I have to make:

- ID (INT, Unique)
- Title (Char ~ 30chars)
- Description (TEXT/Char ~ 150 chars)
- CoordinatesG - google map's coordinates(Check how google maps manage this)
- CoordinatesX - different coordinates type for the POI unit

TODO

# Create a Project
# Define a simple set with POI data(JSON), based on the structure above.
